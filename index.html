            Hello, my name is Brian Parkison. This is a photo of my cat Seymour (this is better than a photo of me anyway). I grew up in Muncie, Indiana, and attended Ball State University for my undergraduate studies. I've decided to pursue a web development certificate for personal enrichment reasons. I've been an employee at IUPUI since 2019, and my hobbies include watching scary movies and birdwatching.
