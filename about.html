            I am taking this class as part of a web development certificate. I am pursuing the web development certificate because I find the classes interesting, and I'd like to be able to do more when it comes to web stuff in general. This certificate and these classes will also help me better understand some systems that I bump up against at work.

                <li>I hope to be able to connect the content that I learn in this class with the content I have learned in prior classes in the same program.</li>
